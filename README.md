# Pulsar Agent ðŸŒŒ  
*A self-evolving LLM agent framework for autonomous task exploration and memory-driven learning.*

---

## ðŸŒ  Overview

**Pulsar** is an open framework for building **autonomous, self-evolving agents** powered by large language models (LLMs). Inspired by the behavior of independent explorers, Pulsar decomposes user prompts into actionable tasks, learns from every interaction, and continuously improves future decision-making through a persistent memory module.

> Think of Pulsar as an LLM that doesnâ€™t just respond â€” it *remembers*, *adapts*, and *evolves*.

## ðŸ§± Origin & Community

Pulsar is inspired by our work in the Minecraft AI project, where we build robust and extensible LLM agents to act as the cognitive core for in-game AI characters. These agents need to reason, reflect, and coordinate with othersâ€”driving the need for modular, prompt-driven architectures like PandexAgent.

We welcome collaboration, discussion, and ideas. Join us in the Minecraft AI Discord server to connect with our community and explore how Pulsar and other tools are shaping AI in virtual environments.

## ðŸ§  Key Features

- **Self-Evolving Agent Architecture**  
  Modular agents that adapt based on what theyâ€™ve learned.

- **Task-Oriented Processing**  
  Incoming prompts are parsed into tasks and subtasks, handled sequentially or in parallel.

- **Memory Module**  
  Persistent memory tracks prior discoveries, outputs, and decisions â€” fueling smarter future actions.

- **Autonomous Decision Loops**  
  Agents can initiate follow-up actions, revise strategies, and reflect on their own reasoning.

- **LLM-Agnostic Backend**  
  Plug in your favorite foundation model (OpenAI, Claude, DeepSeek, local models, etc.).
